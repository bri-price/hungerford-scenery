# Hungerford Scenery

This is an add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator to correct some of the scenery around Hungerford, Berkshire in the UK. (Specifically, the massive chasm that ran along the river and canal).

I offer no guarantees as to its accuracy or even that it will work, but you are free to use, copy and modify for you own use if you want to.
